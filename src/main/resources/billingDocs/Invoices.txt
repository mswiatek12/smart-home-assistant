Smart Home Assistant: Invoices and Receipts

This document explains how to access your monthly invoices and annual receipts, and details what financial information is included in these documents.

1. Accessing Monthly Invoices

Invoices provide a detailed breakdown of your monthly subscription charges, usage, and any applicable taxes.

Delivery: Invoices are automatically generated and emailed to the primary account holder's email address on the billing date each month.

App Access: You can always find your last 12 months of invoices directly within the Billing History section of the Smart Home Assistant mobile application or web portal.

Invoice Content: Each invoice includes:

Invoice Number and Date

Customer ID and Billing Address

Detailed breakdown of services (e.g., Pro Plan Subscription)

The total amount charged and payment method used

Applicable tax rate (if any)

2. Annual Receipts and Statements

While invoices are generated monthly, annual subscription users will receive a single, comprehensive annual receipt upon renewal.

Annual Receipt: This receipt confirms payment for the entire upcoming 12-month period and serves as the official proof of payment for tax or corporate reimbursement purposes.

Downloading Receipts: Annual receipts are available for download in PDF format from the Billing History section alongside your monthly invoices.

3. Resolving Invoice Discrepancies

If you notice an incorrect charge or discrepancy on your invoice, please take the following steps:

Compare the charge against the Pricing.txt document to confirm the standard rate for your plan.

If an error is suspected, gather the Invoice Number and your Customer ID.

Contact a Billing Specialist immediately through the official support channel for immediate review and resolution.
