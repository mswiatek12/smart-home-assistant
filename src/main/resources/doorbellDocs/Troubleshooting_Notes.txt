Smart Doorbell: Troubleshooting and Common Issues
This guide provides solutions for the most frequent issues encountered with your Smart Doorbell, including connectivity failure, poor video quality, and inconsistent motion detection.
1. Connectivity and Live View Issues
Symptom: The doorbell is offline in the mobile app, or the live view takes too long to load.
Issue
	Potential Cause
	Solution
	"Offline" Status
	Weak Wi-Fi signal or network change.
	1. Check the doorbell's connection status light (usually blinking red/amber). 2. Ensure your Wi-Fi router is functioning. 3. If signal is poor, consider installing a Wi-Fi repeater or moving the router closer to the door.
	Slow Live View
	Low upload speed from your home internet.
	Test your internet's upload speed (should be > 2 Mbps for HD streaming). Temporarily set the doorbell's video quality to Standard Definition in the app settings.
	Delayed Notifications
	Mobile app background restrictions or battery saver mode.
	Ensure the mobile app is exempt from battery optimization settings on your phone to allow real-time push notifications.
	2. Motion Detection Problems
Symptom: The doorbell records too many false alerts (cars, trees) or misses people entirely.
Issue
	Potential Cause
	Solution
	Too Many Alerts
	Motion sensitivity is too high, or detection zones are too broad.
	1. Adjust the Motion Sensitivity setting to "Low" or "Medium." 2. Use the Motion Zone feature in the app to exclude busy streets, tree branches, or neighboring property.
	Missing People
	Objects are moving too quickly, or the detection zone is too narrow.
	1. Ensure the entire entryway is included in the motion zone. 2. For battery models, increasing the Detection Frequency may help, but will reduce battery life.
	Night Vision Failure
	IR light reflection off a nearby wall or object (e.g., hanging wreath).
	Check the doorbell's field of view for reflective surfaces close to the lens. Try cleaning the lens, as smudges can cause IR blooming.
	3. Power and Charging Issues
Symptom: The battery is draining quickly, or the hardwired doorbell is not charging.
* Rapid Battery Drain: If the doorbell is positioned in an area with high activity (lots of traffic) and the motion sensitivity is high, it will drain faster. Solution: Lower motion sensitivity and reduce the live-view length to conserve power.
* Hardwired Not Charging: Your existing chime transformer may not provide enough voltage (minimum 16V AC is typically required). Solution: Have a qualified electrician confirm the transformer voltage. If it is too low, it will need to be replaced with a higher-rated one.
* Cold Weather: Lithium batteries perform poorly in extreme cold. Solution: If temperatures are below freezing for extended periods, battery performance degradation is normal. Allow the battery to warm up before attempting a charge cycle.
